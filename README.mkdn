This is a fill-in-the-blank template for writing Python scripts that
use the excellent [plac](http://code.google.com/p/plac/) for argument
parsing and [logging](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) for
giving status messages.

I use this template whenever I create a new Python script. Now you can
too. Don't fork this on GitHub. Just download the
[template file](https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/python-script-template/raw/master/python-script.py)
and fill in the blanks.
